# First the topology:

> Name the routers R1 and R2
> Router R2 will be used to ssh to R1. The username and passwords used will be authenticated using the databse on the Radius Server

## Create the network topology

> All three devices will be on the same network.

> R1 is 192.168.1.1 /24

> R2 is 192.168.1.2 /24

> The server is 192.168.1.3 /24 (To configure the Ip on radius server go to config-Interface-Ipv4)

## In the Radius server:

> Make sure to turn on the server

> Put R1 as the client name and the Ip of the interface facing the server as Client IP

> Set the secret. This will work as a password and should match on teh device when configured there

>Click add and save

> Now in the lower window create your user. They will be used to log into the router (similar to the command username user password password on the local router)

> Put the username and the password, click add and then save

## Now in router 1

> Make sure to ping the 192.168.1.2 and .3 to verify connectivity

> First tell the router to use aaa auth

> then define a backup user and password. This will only be used in case the Radius server is down and you need access to the router

> Now define the group. First comes radius and then local. This means the local user you defined before will only be used if Radius auth is unreachable

> Replace the server Ip with whichever Ip you have put on your Radius server interface

> The key should be the same as the one in the Radius server setup window
